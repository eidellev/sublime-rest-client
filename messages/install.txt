Thanks for trying out Sublime REST Client!
==========================================

Sublime REST Client allows you to define and send HTTP requests directly
from Sublime Text 4.

Sublime REST Client is inspired by the excellent VSCode REST Client [1]
extension and is supported by the amazing urllib3 [2] Python library.

This project is in ALPHA stage, if you notice any errors or would like to
suggest features, please raise an issue in our tracker:

https://github.com/yeraydiazdiaz/sublime-rest-client/issues

Happy HTTP requesting!
